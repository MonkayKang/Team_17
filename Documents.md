# **Zombie Survial**
## Introduction
> **O**ur game was first created as a project for Rapid Development. The concept for the game was created when we pitch in the idea of both Open World and Survival. Pairing it with 2D Pixel Graphic, it was what made the game as it was.

>So, Enjoy our Game and Have Fun Slashing Those Undead!

## Outline:
### Our Game is a 2D survival-based game where the more enemies you kill, the better weapons you get from the shop. The main premise of our game revolves around slaying enemies and getting coins from them.
- We envision our user’s to have a fun memorable moment with their little pixel character that they represent and try to survive. We also envision that the players will have more hacking and slashing with the greater the weapon they obtain.
  
-	The larger vision of our game is to add a reward-like system, making the player not only powerful, but also facing increasing challenges throughout.

# **_The Main Mechanic_** 
The goal of our survival game was the introduction of a shop feature with a unique design to keep the player from forgetting the shop exist
We also decided to add some Sub-Mechanic 

## Sub-Mechanic
-	_Killing enemies for coins_
-	_Surviving_
-	_Upgrading or getting better weapons_

## Map Layout
### The layout of our game is an open world grass land where you play as a **Boy Farmer** fighting agaisnt a horde of **_Undead Enemies._** Our game was designed mainly for PC/Laptop interface. The Audip that you hear is an **upbeat** byte song.

# Cooding
Most coding was done through my knowledge and work throughout my classes from the previous year. Although there are some coding which is not my own writing.
These are:

## _Others:_
-	For “Game Manager” “Lerp” and “Text Display” was all used from a previous class in last semester and therefore technically not my own
-	The Enemy Following the player was from:
  
[2D Enemy AI Follow Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SXa10ILJms)

## **_AI_**:
-	The only time AI was used for coding was the weapon rotation and to fix small issues that I myself couldn’t fix. The weapon rotation script used my own code (Which didn’t work properly) and although it gave me it’s own version. I adjusted parts of the code.
>	An example of when 99 percent of the code was mine, but 1 percent AI. Was the PlayerMovement “Flip”, as mine own code didn’t work as intended
